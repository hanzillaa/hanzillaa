### Howdy 👋
* I am looking to expand my range in programming languages and try out some pretty basic automation of certain processes on my devices.
* I'm most familiar with C# programming and have worked with C++ a bit when I was working on operating systems in school. I also worked quite a bit with MATLAB doing pretty extensive data analysis for neural networks. That being said, I'm really interested in getting more involved with data analysis and AI as well.
* I'm also trying to collaborate on game development. I have quite a few ideas I would like to explore/share.
* I'm currently learning Python, just working on basic applications to get a feel for structures and keywords. If you have any tips to share, please feel free!
* My next projects I'd like to work on in Python are a text to speech bot and perhaps something that will work on my emails.
